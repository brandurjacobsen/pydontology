# Annotation classes
These classes enable use of typing.Annotated to provide RDFS and SHACL metadata
to attributes of the ontology classes, which is then used in the construction
of the ontology graph and SHACL graph.

Not all RDFS or SHACL directives are supported currently. Contributions are welcome!
